# Hand and Face Tracking Using Python

This project implements hand and face tracking using Python and OpenCV, leveraging MediaPipe for efficient and accurate detection. The application provides a robust framework to detect, track, and analyze hand and face movements in real-time.

## Features
- Real-time hand and face detection.
- Tracks multiple landmarks for hands and face.
- Lightweight and efficient, built on MediaPipe and OpenCV.
- Easy-to-understand Python codebase for learning and customization.

## Requirements
To run this project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
